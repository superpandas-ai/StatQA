  "instruction": "You should only reply with one answer in JSON format containing two keys: 'columns' and 'methods'. The value of 'columns' is a list of columns' headers relevant to the given statistical question, and the value of 'methods' is a list containing all methods you think applicable. For example: {\"columns\": [\"c1\", \"c2\", \"...\"], \"methods\": [\"m1\", \"m2\", \"...\"]}. If you think there is a strata or control variable involved, put its column header in the last item of the columns list.
